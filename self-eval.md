# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
In all honesty, it felt frustrating! At first, anyways. Some of the challenges were easier than others for me, and I found myself feeling defeated and down on myself. I realized I need to learn better strategies to refresh my mind. Once I was able to figure things out, though, (and who knows if I did them correctly!) I felt a sense of pride and accomplishment. I'm happy with the work I did.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
My focus is getting a lot better. I need to take better breaks that don't just involve me staring from one screen to another. Going outside, walking around, doing some affirmations would be more helpful for me there, I think. I will put those things into practice and see how they go.

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
Everything I learned from this excercise is useful. OOP is an important thing to know and I'm excited to get more practice in it and delving deeper into the things that can be done with it.
